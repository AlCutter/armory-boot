Introduction
============

This [TamaGo](https://github.com/f-secure-foundry/tamago) based unikernel
acts as a primary boot loader for the [USB armory Mk II](https://github.com/f-secure-foundry/usbarmory/wiki),
allowing boot of kernel images (e.g. Linux) from either the eMMC card or an
external microSD card.

Binary releases
===============

Pre-compiled binary releases are available
[here](https://github.com/f-secure-foundry/armory-boot/releases).

Compiling
=========

Build the [TamaGo compiler](https://github.com/f-secure-foundry/tamago-go)
(or use the [latest binary release](https://github.com/f-secure-foundry/tamago-go/releases/latest)):

```
git clone https://github.com/f-secure-foundry/tamago-go -b tamago1.14.6
cd tamago-go/src && ./all.bash
cd ../bin && export TAMAGO=`pwd`/go
```

The `BOOT` environment variable must be set to either `uSD` or `eMMC` to
configure the bootloader media for `/boot/armory-boot.conf`, as well as kernel
images, location.

The `START` environment variable must be set to the offset of the first valid
ext4 partition where `/boot/armory-boot.conf` is located (typically 5242880 for
USB armory Mk II default pre-compiled images).

Build the `armory-boot.imx` application executable (note that on secure booted
units the `imx_signed` target should be used instead):

```
git clone https://github.com/f-secure-foundry/armory-boot && cd armory-boot
make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-eabi- imx BOOT=uSD START=5242880
```

Installing
==========

The `armory-boot.imx` file can be flashed on the internal eMMC card or an
external micro SD card as shown in[these instructions](https://github.com/f-secure-foundry/usbarmory/wiki/Boot-Modes-(Mk-II)#flashing-imx-native-images).

Configuration
=============

The bootloader expects a single configuration file to read information on the
command line, kernel and device tree blob paths along with their SHA256
checksum for validation.

Example `/boot/armory-boot.conf` configuration file:

```
{
  "debug": false,
  "kernel": [
    "/boot/zImage-5.4.51-0-usbarmory",
    "aceb3514d5ba6ac591a7d5f2cad680e83a9f848d19763563da8024f003e927c7"
  ],
  "dtb": [
    "/boot/imx6ulz-usbarmory-default-5.4.51-0.dtb",
    "60d4fe465ef60042293f5723bf4a001d8e75f26e517af2b55e6efaef9c0db1f6"
  ],
  "cmdline": "console=ttymxc1,115200 root=/dev/mmcblk1p1 rootwait rw"
}
```
